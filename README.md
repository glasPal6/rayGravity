# rayGravity

Just a quick weekend project with a basic gravity sim.

It can be optimised to handle a larger number of particles. This can be done with spacial partitioning, i.e. the space can be divided into quadrants, where particles outside this quadrant are attracted to the mean position and total mass of that quadrant.
